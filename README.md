Playground for some ideas inspired by [Peter Norvig][] and [Anthony Hay][].

Unlike their approaches, we focus on *simplicity* and *correctness* over
shortness. These concepts are related but not identical. In particular, while
correctness is relatively straightforward in Python, it’s less so in (classical)
C++. Modern C++ and Boost to the rescue. And as for shortness, Peter’s and
Anthony’s solutions take shortcuts at the cost of readability. We abstain from
this.
